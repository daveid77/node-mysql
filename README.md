cd node-mysql
npm install
```

## Available Node Commands

* `node bamazonCustomer.js`
* `node bamazonManager.js` 

## Misc Notes

* Apps set to run once each, not loop through Inquirer prompts over and over, but code written so that would be possibly by simply calling primary functions at ends of each behavior process.
* Did not make it to Challenge #3: Supervisor View.
